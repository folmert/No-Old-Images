# No Old Images (NOI, /neuÌ¯/)
Simplifies searching for fresh content by generating CSS to hide already displayed images. You can paste the generated CSS into a style manager (i.e. [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)) to make it active permanently. Currently works only with Google Images and since it originally displays images only in base64 it requires running NOI to generate `href` on each linked image that Google Images display, in order to make the CSS active.

are not going to be displayed again in same or any other search results (or will be grayed out):
